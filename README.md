# Homework2-BlockChain

Code for HW2 in Blockchain and application for GSU

This is java code to find the plaintext given a SHA-1 hashtext.
I have never used github (I know, its embarassing) so please forgive me, I do not know the best way to make the code provided runable.
The code was written in Eclipse and does function properly.
The four inputs are hardcoded and the code will run to find the solutions for all four inputs at the same time.

# Solutions

For input 1 the plaintext was "letmein" and it was found in 16 tries and 39 ms.
Input 2 the plaintext was "vjhtrhsvdctcegth" it took 999968 tries and 4038ms.
Input 3 the plaintext of the salt was "slayer" and the plaintext password was "harib". this took 546155 tries and 1412 ms.
Input 4 I could not find actual plaintext as it would have taken too long. Estimated time to find answer 8 days?(just a guess).

# Bonus
 I did not attempt to code the bonus as time was an issue but as a general intuition I would use some sort of hashmap or dictionary function with known key value pairs for SHA-1 hashes and this would significantly reduce time to compute plaintext of input 4
